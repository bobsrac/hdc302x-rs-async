## Rust HDC302x(-Q1) Low-Power Humidity and Temperature Digital Sensor Driver

This is a platform-agnostic Rust driver for the HDC3020, HDC3021, HDC3022, HDC3020-Q1,
HDC3021-Q1 and HDC3022-Q1 low-power humidity and temperature digital sensors using the
[`embedded-hal-async`] traits.  This is current no support for a blocking API.  This driver was
inspired by [Diego Barrios Romero's hdc20xx-rs driver](https://github.com/eldruin/hdc20xx-rs).

[`embedded-hal-async`]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/tree/master/embedded-hal-async

This driver allows you to:
- Start and read samples in both one-shot and auto (self-timed) mode.
- Read last temperature and humidity values in auto mode.
- Read minimum and maximum temperature and humidity values in auto mode.
- Exit auto mode.
- Enable/disable the heater, including 100%, 50%, and 25% settings.
- Trigger a software reset.
- Read the manufacturer ID.
- Read the device serial number.
- Read and optionally clear the device status bits.
- async support.

This driver does not yet support the following device features:
- Alerts (read/write and non-volatile storage of setpoints).
- Offset calibration (non-volatile storage of temperature and relative humidity offsets).
- Configuration of post-reset state (default behavior after power-on and software reset).
- Blocking API support.

### Supported devices: HDC3020, HDC3021, HDC3022, HDC3020-Q1, HDC3021-Q1, HDC3022-Q1

The following description is copied from the manufacturer's datasheet:

The HDC302x-Q1 is an integrated capacitive based relative humidity (RH) and temperature sensor.
The device provides high accuracy measurements over a wide supply range (1.62 V – 5.5 V), along
with ultra-low power consumption in a compact 2.5-mm × 2.5-mm package. Both the temperature and
humidity sensors are 100% tested and trimmed on a production setup that is NIST traceable and
verified with equipment that is calibrated to ISO/IEC 17025 standards.

Offset Error Correction reduces RH sensor offset due to aging, exposure to extreme operating
conditions, and contaminants to return device to within accuracy specifications. For battery
IoT applications, auto measurement mode and ALERT feature enable low system power by maximizing
MCU sleep time. There are four different I2C addresses that support speeds up to 1 MHz. A
heating element is available to dissipate condensation and moisture.

The HDC3020-Q1 is an open cavity package without protective cover. Two device variants have a
cover option to protect the open cavity RH sensor: HDC3021-Q1 and HDC3022-Q1. HDC3021-Q1 has
removable protective tape to allow conformal coatings and PCB wash. HDC3022-Q1 has a permanent
IP67 filter membrane to protect against dust, water and PCB wash. All three package variants
have wettable flanks option.

### TODO: Usage examples

To use this driver, import this crate and an `embedded_hal_async` implementation,
then instantiate the device.
